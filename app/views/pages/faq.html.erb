  Q. Does this site have bugs?
</p>
<p>
  A. It's interesting you should ask that. The world is full of bugs, and often we can encounter them in the most unexpected of places. Sometimes in the kitchen late at night. Sometimes ealry in the morning when we're in the bathroom. And then, on extremely rare occasions, perhaps, just perhaps, whilst we're browsing the interwebs navigating around certain sites. Like, you know...maybe.
