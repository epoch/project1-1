<h2>EatWhat?</h2>

<p>Well hello there.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Information regarding nutrition plans, FAQ, and contact details are available without the need to sign up. Full functionality of the site requires the user to create an account and sign in.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The EatWhat? application is intended to assist users in determining their recommened daily macronutrient intakes, based on their age, gender, height, weight, activity level and desired nutrition plan. Once a user completes their profile, they will receive recommended daily macronutrient values, calculated using the Mifflin - St Jeor equation. 
</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p>The application provides the user the opportunity to guess the macronutrient values in each meal consumed. When adding a meal, the user is prompted to enter their estimation of fat, protein and carbohydrate values for the respective meal. The user then adds the foods that constitute the meal, together with the quantity consumed.</p> 

<p>Each meal a user adds to their profile is stored, and can be viewed at a later date for reference purposes. Meals can also be deleted from the user's profile.</p>

<h3>API</h3>

<p>Data regarding food macronutrient content is provided courtesy of the NutritionIx API. Documentation for the NutritionIX API is available <a href="https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v1_1">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>Sincere thanks to the all the workers and middlemen, between the Colombian coffee plantations and Sourdough bakery on York St. Huge thanks goes to Joel and DT, who have be instrumental in the creation of this app. It was remarkable that they did not completely lose it when faced with fixing countless bugs, which were often due to the absence of a comma, parentheses, or plural/singular words. My bad guys... *hat tip*</p>
